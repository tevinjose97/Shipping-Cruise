# Shipping-Cruise

## Project Description
This project is an example of a basic program which stores the data of passenger’s details and the ship details separately and provides admin rights to the officials of the shipping cruise and allows the officials to set a variable cost based on the requirements of the respective passenger, adding incentives and allowing the user to view their passenger bookings. 
<br>It enables the passenger to search for the ship on the basis of destination, facilities, dates and length of cruise.
